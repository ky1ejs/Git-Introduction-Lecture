### By the end of this:

<br>

You should have a rough idea of what Git does

<br>

You should have the tools and foundation knowledge to learn Git

### How are we going to do this:

1. Who is Kyle, why does he know Git?
2. What's Version Control?
2. Why was Git created? - __*Brief History*__
3. The story of a dev team
4. Some basics Git commands
6. Q&A - _but ask whenever a question pops in to your head_

^ History helpful when understanding why Git is made the way it is

##What is Version Control?

^ - you've all done it before

^ - It's keeping track of changes
- You make a change, that's version 1

^ - why do this?
- It's often important to be able to go back to old versions
- Think about using cmd+z
- Other features of VCS - BRANCHES
- we'll see later

^ - How can you control versions?
